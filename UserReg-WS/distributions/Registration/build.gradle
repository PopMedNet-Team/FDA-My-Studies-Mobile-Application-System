/**
 This file can be used to create a distribution of the User Registration Web Server.  

 In the following, we assume your labkey code enlistment is located at
        C:\labkey
 And the Registration module is located in:
        C:\labkey\server\modules\UserReg-WS
 You will need to do the following:
   1. Edit this file to update the "versionPrefix" property below to correspond to the 
      version of the distribution you are creating.
   2. Create the directory for this build.gradle file to live in.  This directory can be, for example:
        C:\labkey\server\modules\UserReg-WS\distributions\Registration
   3. Put this build.gradle file in that directory
        C:\labkey\server\modules\UserReg-WS\distributions\Registration\build.gradle
   4. Edit your settings.gradle file to include the distributions project.  That is, add the following
      line at the end of that file: 
        include ":server:modules:UserReg-WS"
        include ":server:modules:UserReg-WS:distributions:Registration"
